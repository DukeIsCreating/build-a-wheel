# Build a Tabletop Spinning Prize Wheel

Nothing is actually available just yet, please come back later...

This is the repository for the eagerly ancitipated release of my wheel's model files and build instructions.
If you want to build your own spinning prize wheel that is card-table sized (86 centimeters, or 34 inches, or just a little under 1.5 dogs in diameter)  using a 3D printer and a cutting machine, you've come to the right place.

Many hours of hard work and thoughtful design went into these models and instructions.
Since I can't feasibly build a wheel for everyone who wants one, I am releasing my model files and build instructions.
I don't expect to make money off of this project, but receiving credit for my work is nice.
Therefore, if you share, modify and re-release, or feature a wheel built from this kit, please give credit.
