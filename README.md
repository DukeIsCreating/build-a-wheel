# Build a Tabletop Gaming Wheel

This is the repository for my wheel's model files and build instructions.
If you want to build your own tabletop gaming wheel that is card-table sized (86 centimeters, or 34 inches, or just a little under 1.5 dogs in diameter) using a 3D printer and a cutting machine, you've come to the right place.

Many hours of hard work and thoughtful design went into these models and instructions.
Since I can't feasibly build a wheel for everyone who wants one, I am releasing my model files and build instructions.
I don't expect or want to make money off of this project, but receiving credit for my work is nice.
Therefore, if you share, modify and re-release, or feature a wheel built from this kit, please give credit.
