<h2>Instructions</h2>
<ol>
<li>Take the Pointer Shaft (PTRSHAFT) and tactical Band (BAND-82). Slip the band onto the shaft between the gap. Use the tapered edge to help guild the band into position as far as it will go. Make sure the band is not creased or wrinkled.</li>
<li>Take the Pointer Cartridge (PTRCART) and slide the Pointer Shaft into it so that the rectangular part of the shaft sticks through the round hole. It should only fit properly in one orientation. Fit the Band through the slots on either side of the pointer shaft. Once again, make sure the band is not creased or wrinkled.</li>
<li>Fit the assembled Pointer Cartridge into the PLAYERMID portion of the player station, point outward. at the same time, run the band through the slot inside the station on either side of the Pointer Shaft.</li>
<li>Stretch the band and run it through the posts inside of the player station. Length of band run can be varied to configure desired tension.</li>
<li>Ensure that the Pointer Shaft turns freely and returns roughly to its center position. Adjust tactical band tension as necessary for this to happen.</li>
<li>Fit the PLAYERTOP on top of the PLAYERMID</li>
<li>Fit a Pointer (PTRMED) onto the Pointer Shaft.</li>
</ol>
