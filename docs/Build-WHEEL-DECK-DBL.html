<h2>Instructions</h2>
<ol>
<li>Be sure to have lots of space available for this stage of assembly.</li>
<li>Use a WHEELC to attach two WHEELB parts together, by fitting pags from WHEELC into the holes on WHEELB. It doesn't really matter if you work clockwise or counterclockwise.</li>
<li>As you work through these next steps, keep the wheel deck upside down, such that the stairstep portion of the WHEELB pieces is facing up.
<li>Attach another WHEELC to one of the WHEELB pieces from the last step, next to the last WHEELC.</li>
<li>Attach another WHEELC to one of the WHEELB pieces from the last step, on the other side of the first WHEELC.</li>
<li>Attach WHEELA to WHEELB, by fitting the pegs from WHEELA into the holes from both WHEELB pieces. The peg should protrude through the hole.</li>
<li>Attach another WHEELC to the WHEELB, next to the last WHEELC. This one should now be hanging off of the other side of the WHEELB.</li>
<li>Attach another WHEELB to the WHEELC that is hanging off of the prior WHEELB. Also attach it to WHEELA.</li>
<li>Continue to work in a circle until all WHEELB and WHEELC parts are placed.</li>
<li>Align the pegs of the ROTOR with the pegs of the WHEELA piece, and press the ROTOR into place.</li>
<li>Without removing the adhesive, align all 8 felt dampeners (DAMPEN-FELT) in a circle on the bottom of the wheel, so that they do not overlap or gap, and are all equidistant from the center/edge.
<li>One by one, remove the adhesive from the felt dampeners, and affix the dampeners into place.
<li>With the help of a partner, carefully turn the entire wheel deck over, giving a lot of support to joints between pieces.</li>
<li>Fit the SPOKERIM-BRZ parts into place along the outside of the WHEELC circle, each spanning two WHEELC parts.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Tips and Notes</h2>
<ul>
<li>The fit of the wheel deck pieces is supposed to be quite tight. If you are having trouble getting the pieces to fit together, you may <em>GENTLY</em> employ a rubber mallet to aid driving the pegs into their respective holes.</li>
</ul>
