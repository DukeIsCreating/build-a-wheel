<h2>Instructions</h2>
<ol>
<li>Take a STRUT, and with its bearings facing toward the SUPPORT, slide the STRUT onto the end of the SUPPORT. Repeat for each of the four STRUTS.</li>
<li>Take each SUPPORT, both the ones with STRUTs attached and the ones without STRUTs, and using the peg on the STRUT-holding end of the support, attach it to an OUTER-BASE.</li>
<li>Take the SUPPORTs with STRUTs attached, and attach the peg at the end opposite the STRUT-holding end to the WEIGHTED-BASE at 90 degree angles from each other.</li>
<li>Take the SUPPORTs without STRUTs attached, and attach the peg at the end opposite the STRUT-holding end to the WEIGHTED-BASE at the 45 degree angle between each STRUTted SUPPORT.</li>
<li>Take the Main Bearing (BRG-6208ZZ) to a well-ventilated area. Spray WD-40 into the groove between the bearing housing and cover, and work the bearing to loosen it.</li>
<li>Repeat previous step until bearing spins freely.</li>
<li>Wipe excess grease off of the bearing using a rag.</li>
<li>Take the Main Bearing and fit it on the post on top of the WEIGHTED-BASE.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Tips and Notes</h2>
<ul>
<li>OUTER-BASE components will not be attached to each other at the end of this step, but should arrange in a circle snugly.</li>
<li>Ivory-towered engineers may disapprove of the use of WD-40 to loosen the packed lubricant in the bearing. It does reduce the load that can be borne by the bearing, but we care little for that as this bearing is rated for tons of load. We do care that the bearing spins freely.</li>
