<h2>Instructions</h2>
<ol>
<li>Take the five OUTERTOP parts, and place each of them so that they straddle two OUTERBASE components, working in a circle around the wheel. The peg holes on OUTERTOP should line up with the pegs on OUTERBASE.</li>
<li>Take the three PLAYERMOUNT parts, and place each of them straddling two OUTERBASE components, occupying the remaining three spots not occupied by OUTERTOP components. They should fit over the pegs on the OUTERBASE components the same as the OUTERTOPs.</li>
<li>Starting with the PLAYERENDSPACER, arrange spacer and PLAYERBTM elements as desired on the PLAYERMOUNT parts, starting with the rightmost peg and working clockwise. See notes for common arrangements. Common arrangements are END, SPACER x3, RED, SPACER x2, YELLOW, SPACER x2, BLUE, SPACER x4</li>
<li>Take the three OUTERTOPPLAYER parts, and place them over the spacer, PLAYERBTM, and OUTERBASE parts.</li>
<li>Take all of the PLAYERCAPSPACER parts, and place each of them on an open peghole in the OUTERTOPPLAYER components, pressing the peg down fully into the PLAYERSPACER or PLAYERENDSPACER below.
</ol>
